### Bluetooth Audio Visualizer With 1088-Style LED Matrix

This project started with an impulse purchase of a bunch of MSGEQ7 IC's from an online retailer. These chips provide an analog output representing a 7-band graphic equalizer. Combined with some cheap MH-M28 drop-in bluetooth modules, I thought the MSGEQ7 could be a good backbone for a fun little module. Thus was born what would be come the Sound Guy, a portable usb-powered (for now) bluetooth to 3.5mm Aux adapter with an 8x8 LED matrix playing a visualization of the audio being played. This is a work-in-progress, thanks for checking it out!
